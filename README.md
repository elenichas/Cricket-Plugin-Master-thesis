# Cricket Plugin for Grasshopper (Master's Thesis Project)

This repository hosts the **Cricket Plugin**, a Grasshopper-based plugin developed as part ofmy master's thesis project. It provides tools for complex spatial analysis, including color encoding, model synthesis, and mesh segmentation, which can be applied in architectural and design workflows.
Cricket Plug in for Rhino Grassshoper is based on a 3D implementation of the WFC algorithm

## Features

- **Mesh Segmentation**: break down the input geometry into distinct tiles and generate binary codes to identify unique tiles.
- **Color Encoding**: Color code the unique tiles.
- **Model Synthesis**: Gnerate an output model using a 3D implementation of the WFC algorithm.


## Repository Structure

- **GHFiles/**: Contains Grasshopper definition files (`.gh`) 
- **README.md**: Overview documentation 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rhino3D** and **Grasshopper**: Required for running the plugin and Grasshopper files.
- **.NET Core SDK** (if additional plugin compilation is required).
